# 🚀 Quest: Scalability Engineering

***Make it handle the entire internet.***

**The Mission:** Your app works for one user. What happens when 500 people hit it at once? Find the breaking point and push past it.    
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Requires system resources)

## 🥉 Tier 1: Bronze (The Baseline)

*Objective: Stress test your system.*

### ⚔️ Main Objectives
- [x] **Load Test:** Install k6 or Locust.
- [x] **The Crowd:** Simulate 50 concurrent users hitting your service.
- [x] **Record Stats:** Document your Response Time (Latency) and Error Rate.

### 💡 Intel
**Concurrent Users:** This isn't total hits. This is 50 people clicking at the exact same second.    
**Baseline:** You can't improve what you don't measure.

### ✅ Verification (Loot)
- [ ] Screenshot of terminal output showing 50 concurrent users.
- [ ] Documented baseline p95 response time.

## 🥈 Tier 2: Silver (The Scale-Out)

*Objective: One server isn't enough. Build a fleet.*

### ⚔️ Main Objectives
- [ ] **The Horde:** Ramp up to 200 concurrent users.
- [ ] **Clone Army:** Run 2+ instances of your app (containers) using Docker Compose.
- [ ] **Traffic Cop:** Put a Load Balancer (Nginx) in front to split traffic between instances.
- [ ] **Speed Limit:** Keep response times under 3 seconds.

### 💡 Intel

**Horizontal Scaling:** Don't make the server stronger (Vertical). Just add more servers (Horizontal).    
**Load Balancer:** The entry point. It decides which container does the work.

### ✅ Verification (Loot)
- [ ] docker ps showing multiple app containers + 1 Nginx container.
- [ ] Load test results showing success with 200 users.

## 🥇 Tier 3: Gold (The Speed of Light)

*Objective: Optimization and Caching.*

### ⚔️ Main Objectives
- [ ] **The Tsunami:** Handle 500+ concurrent users (or 100 req/sec).
- [ ] **Cache It:** Implement Redis. Store results in memory so you don't hit the DB every time.
- [ ] **Bottleneck Analysis:** Find out what was slow before, and explain how you fixed it.
- [ ] **Stability:** Error rate must stay under 5% during the tsunami.

### 💡 Intel
**Caching:** The fastest query is the one you don't have to make.    
**Bottlenecks:** Is it the CPU? The Database? The Network? Find the weak link.

### ✅ Verification (Loot)
- [ ] Evidence of Caching (headers, logs, or speed comparison).
- [ ] Load test results: 500 users with <5% errors.
- [ ] "Bottleneck Report" (2-3 sentences on what you fixed).

**🧰 Recommended Loadout:** k6 (or Locust), Nginx, Docker Compose, Redis
